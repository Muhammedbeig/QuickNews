About The Project
In today's fast-paced world, staying informed is crucial, but reading long articles can be time-consuming. QuickNews tackles this problem by acting as an intelligent agent that provides concise, AI-generated summaries from any article URL.

But it doesn't stop there. QuickNews also functions as a powerful answer engine. Ask it any question, and it will use the Google Gemini API and a concurrent web-scraping backend to deliver comprehensive, context-aware answers. Built with a robust Django backend and a sleek, responsive vanilla JavaScript frontend, QuickNews is designed for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Key Features
ü§ñ Dual-Mode AI Processing: Intelligently handles two types of input:

URL Summarization: Paste any news article link to get a quick, accurate summary, author details, and sentiment analysis.

Intelligent Q&A: Ask complex questions in natural language to get direct answers powered by the Google Gemini API.

üåê Context-Aware Search: For questions requiring up-to-date information, the app performs a web search, scrapes the top results concurrently, and feeds the context to the LLM for a rich, informed response.

‚ö° High-Performance Backend: Built with Django and optimized with concurrent web scraping to ensure fast, non-blocking responses even when gathering data from multiple sources.

‚ú® Modern Conversational UI: A clean, chat-based interface built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript that provides a fluid, app-like experience.

üóÇÔ∏è Persistent Chat History: All your summarized articles are saved and grouped by date, allowing you to revisit them anytime.
